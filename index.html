  Computers have become a major factor in the development and operation of the modern industry. From providing means of communications, to operating machines, to facilitating international commerce, to systems animation, computers and their related software programs makes things possible.
  The Computer Software Engineering Technology program prepares students to design, develop, and build customized software programs for specific applications. Specifically, students will learn basic programming, how to interpret specifications, application of software architecture, verification and validation principles, and software performance standards. Students will create software programs which address known specifications. The program emphasizes a practical hands-on education as software projects are required each semester.
